## Cooldown Window, Proving Window and Bonds

This segment lists the cooldown windows and proving windows for every tier of proof in the Taiko protocol.

The cooldown window describes how long after the proof has been provided that the block is verified.

The proving window describes how long a prover has to provide a proof for a block after they have been assigned the block (i.e. a block has been proposed with them as the assigned prover).

We've appended a 4 hour "grace period" temporarily to proving windows, the reason is described [here](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono/blob/main/packages/protocol/contracts/layer1/tiers/TierProviderBase.sol#L13). You can consider the below proving windows + 4 hours as the actual proving window until further notice!

You can find all the corresponding values below in the above link too!

| Tier              | Cooldown Window | Proving Window | Bond      |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Optimistic        | 1440 minutes    | 15 minutes     | 75 TAIKO  |
| SGX               | 240 minutes     | 60 minutes     | 150 TAIKO |
| ZK                | 240 minutes     | 180 minutes    | 225 TAIKO |
| SGX & ZK          | 240 minutes     | 180 minutes    | 225 TAIKO |
| Guardian Minority | 240 minutes     | 0 minutes      | 225 TAIKO |
| Guardian          | 240 minutes     | 0 minutes      | 0 TAIKO   |

<Aside>
Guardian and Guardian Minority proving window is just the grace period (4 hours).
